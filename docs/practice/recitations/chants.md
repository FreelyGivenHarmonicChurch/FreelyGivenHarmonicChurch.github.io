## [The Three Refuges](https://plumvillage.org/library/chants/the-three-refuges/)

I take refuge in the Buddha,<br>
the one who shows me the way in this life.<br>
I take refuge in the Dharma,<br>
the way of understanding and of love.<br>
I take refuge in the Sangha,<br>
the community that lives in harmony and awareness.<br>
**[bell]**<br>

Dwelling in the refuge of Buddha,<br>
I clearly see the path of light and beauty in the world.<br>
Dwelling in the refuge of Dharma,<br>
I learn to open many doors on the path of transformation.<br>
Dwelling in the refuge of Sangha,<br>
shining light that supports me, keeping my practice free of obstruction.<br>
**[bell]**<br>

Taking refuge in the Buddha in myself,<br>
I aspire to help all people recognize their own awakened nature,<br>
realizing the Mind of Love.<br>
Taking refuge in the Dharma in myself,<br>
I aspire to help all people fully master the ways of practice<br>
and walk together on the path of liberation.<br>
Taking refuge in the Sangha in myself,<br>
I aspire to help all people build Fourfold Communities,<br>
to embrace all beings and support their transformation.<br>

## [The Great Bell Chant](https://plumvillage.org/library/chants/the-great-bell-chant/)

May the sound of this bell<br>
penetrate deep into the cosmos<br>
Even in the darkest spots<br>
Living beings are able to hear it clearly<br>
So that all suffering in them cease<br>
Understanding comes to their hearts<br>
And they transcend the path<br>
Of sorrow and death.<br>
The universal Dharma Door<br>
Is already open<br>
The sound of the Rising Tide is heard clearly<br>
The miracle happens<br>
A beautiful child appears in the heart of a lotus flower<br>
One single drop of this compassionate water<br>
Is enough to bring back the refreshing spring<br>
To our mountains and rivers.<br>
Listening to the bell<br>
I feel the afflictions in me begin to dissolve<br>
My mind calm, my body relaxed<br>
A smile is born on my lips<br>
Following the sound of the bell<br>
My breath brings me back to the safe island of mindfulness<br>
In the garden of my heart<br>
The flowers of Peace<br>
Bloom beautifully.<br>
