# Love

> Hatred is, indeed, never appeased by hatred in this world. It is appeased only by loving-kindness. This is an ancient law. - [Buddha](https://www.tipitaka.net/tipitaka/dhp/verseload.php?verse=005)

> ...And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ This is the first commandment. And the second, like it, is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these. - [Jesus](https://biblehub.com/mark/12-30.htm)

> Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that. - Martin Luther King, Jr.

## Love Your Enemies

> You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so? Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. - [Jesus](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-43.htm)

> Hence, only he who is willing to give his body for the sake of the world is fit to be entrusted with the world.
  Only he who can do it with love is worthy of being the steward of the world. - [Lao Tzu](https://terebess.hu/english/tao/wu.html#Kap13)
