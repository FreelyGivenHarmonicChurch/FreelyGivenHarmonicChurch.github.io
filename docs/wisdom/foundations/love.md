# Love

> Hatred is, indeed, never appeased by hatred in this world. It is appeased only by loving-kindness. This is an ancient law. - [Buddha](https://www.tipitaka.net/tipitaka/dhp/verseload.php?verse=005)



> Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that. - Martin Luther King, Jr.
