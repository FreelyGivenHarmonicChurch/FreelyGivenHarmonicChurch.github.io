# Works

Faith Without Works is Dead.


> Genuine religion is not about speculating about God or the soul or about what happened in the past or will happen in the future; it cares only about one thingâ€”finding out exactly what should or should not be done in this lifetime. - Leo Tolstoy

> Our own life must be our lesson. - Thich Nhat Hanh

## Service

> Everybody can be great...because anybody can serve. You don't have to have a college degree to serve. You don't have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love. - Martin Luther King, Jr.
