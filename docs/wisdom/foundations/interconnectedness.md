# Interconnectedness

> All I'm saying is simply this: that all mankind is tied together; all life is interrelated, and we are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. For some strange reason I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. And you can never be what you ought to be until I am what I ought to be - this is the interrelated structure of reality. John Donne caught it years ago and placed it in graphic terms: 'No man is an Island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main'... And then he goes on toward the end to say: 'any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.' And by believing this, by living out this fact, we will be able to remain awake through a great revolution. - [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://www2.oberlin.edu/external/EOG/BlackHistoryMonth/MLK/CommAddress.html)
