# Nonviolence

## Ahimsa

## Reconciliation

> It must be made palpably clear that resistance and nonviolence are not in themselves good. There is another element that must be present in our struggle that then makes our resistance and nonviolence truly meaningful. That element is reconciliation. Our ultimate end must be the creation of the beloved community. The tactics of nonviolence without the spirit of nonviolence may indeed become a new kind of violence. - [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/statement-press-beginning-youth-leadership-conference)
