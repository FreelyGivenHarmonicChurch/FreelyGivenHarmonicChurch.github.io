# Nonviolence

> Violence brings only temporary victories; violence, by creating more social problems than it solves, never brings permanent peace. I am convinced that if we succumb to the temptation to use violence in our struggle for freedom, unborn generations will be the recipients of a long and desolate night of bitterness, and our chief legacy to them will be a never-ending reign of chaos. - [Martin Luther King, Jr](https://bookquoters.com/book/strength-to-love)

## Ahimsa

## Reconciliation

> It must be made palpably clear that resistance and nonviolence are not in themselves good. There is another element that must be present in our struggle that then makes our resistance and nonviolence truly meaningful. That element is reconciliation. Our ultimate end must be the creation of the beloved community. The tactics of nonviolence without the spirit of nonviolence may indeed become a new kind of violence. - [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/statement-press-beginning-youth-leadership-conference)
