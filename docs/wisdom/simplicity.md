# Simplicity

> As for your name and your body, which is the dearer?<br>
> As for your body and your wealth, which is the more to be prized?<br>
> As for gain and loss, which is the more painful?<br>
>
> Thus, an excessive love for anything will cost you dear in the end.<br>
> The storing up of too much goods will entail a heavy loss.<br>
>
> To know when you have enough is to be immune from disgrace.<br>
> To know when to stop is to be preserved from perils.<br>
> Only thus can you endure long.<br>

## Rejecting Mammon

> No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. - [Jesus, Matthew 6:24](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-24.htm)

> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. - [Jesus, Mark 10:25](https://biblehub.com/mark/10-25.htm)

> Then Jesus went into the temple of God and drove out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves. And He said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a ‘den of thieves.’ - [Matthew 21:12-13](https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-12.htm)

<hr>

> And He said to them, “Watch out! Guard yourselves against every form of greed, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.”<br>
><br>
> Then He told them a parable: “The ground of a certain rich man produced an abundance. So he thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, since I have nowhere to store my crops?’ Then he said, ‘This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and will build bigger ones, and there I will store up all my grain and my goods. Then I will say to myself, “You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take it easy. Eat, drink, and be merry!” ’<br>
><br>
> But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be required of you. Then who will own what you have accumulated?’<br>
><br>
> This is how it will be for anyone who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.”<br>
> - [Jesus, The Parable of the Rich Fool, Luke 12:15-21](https://www.biblehub.com/luke/12-15.htm)
