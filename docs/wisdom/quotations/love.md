# Love

> Hatred is, indeed, never appeased by hatred in this world. It is appeased only by loving-kindness. This is an ancient law. - [Buddha](https://www.tipitaka.net/tipitaka/dhp/verseload.php?verse=005)

> ...And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ This is the first commandment. And the second, like it, is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these. - [Jesus](https://biblehub.com/mark/12-30.htm)

## Love Your Enemies

> You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so? Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. - [Jesus](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-43.htm)

## Strength To Love

> Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction. So when Jesus says “Love your enemies,” he is setting forth a profound and ultimately inescapable admonition. Have we not come to such an impasse in the modern world that we must love our enemies– or else? The chain reaction of evil–hate begetting hate, wars producing wars–must be broken, or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation. - [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://bookquoters.com/book/strength-to-love)

## Mercy

## Compassion

> Our job is to love others without stopping to inquire whether or not they are worthy. That is not our business and, in fact, it is nobody's business. What we are asked to do is to love, and this love itself will render both ourselves and our neighbors worthy. - [Thomas Merton](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/161733-our-job-is-to-love-others-without-stopping-to-inquire)

## Sacrifice

> Hence, only he who is willing to give his body for the sake of the world is fit to be entrusted with the world.<br>
> Only he who can do it with love is worthy of being the steward of the world.<br>
> - [Lao Tzu](https://terebess.hu/english/tao/wu.html#Kap13)

> If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul? [Jesus](https://biblehub.com/nkjv/matthew/16.htm)

# Interconnectedness

> All I'm saying is simply this: that all mankind is tied together; all life is interrelated, and we are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. For some strange reason I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. And you can never be what you ought to be until I am what I ought to be - this is the interrelated structure of reality. John Donne caught it years ago and placed it in graphic terms: 'No man is an Island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main'... And then he goes on toward the end to say: 'any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.' And by believing this, by living out this fact, we will be able to remain awake through a great revolution. - [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://www2.oberlin.edu/external/EOG/BlackHistoryMonth/MLK/CommAddress.html)


## Community

> To be a real help to your church or Sangha, you must first light your own fire of understanding, love, solidity, and stillness. Then you will be able to inspire others, whether in an existing group or one you are helping establish. - [Thich Nhat Hahn](https://www.johnworldpeace.com/tnhanh5.html)
