Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And do not bring us to the time of trial, but rescue us from the evil one. Peace Prayer Lord, make us an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let us bring love. Where there is offence, let us bring pardon. Where there is discord, let us bring union. Where there is error, let us bring truth. Where there is doubt, let us bring faith. Where there is despair, let us bring hope. Where there is darkness, let us bring your light. Where there is sadness, let us bring joy. O Master, let us not seek as much to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand, to be loved as to love, for it is in giving that we receive, it is in self-forgetting that we find, it is in pardoning that we are pardoned, it is in dying that we are raised to eternal life. Serenity Prayer God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference. Jesus Prayer Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.","title":"Prayer"},{"location":"prayer/#prayer","text":"","title":"Prayer"},{"location":"prayer/#the-lords-prayer","text":"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
