Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy. - Proverbs 31:8-9 Hence, only he who is willing to give his body for the sake of the world is fit to be entrusted with the world. Only he who can do it with love is worthy of being the steward of the world. - Lao Tzu Hatred is, indeed, never appeased by hatred in this world. It is appeased only by loving-kindness. This is an ancient law. - Buddha ...And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.\u2019 This is the first commandment. And the second, like it, is this: \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no other commandment greater than these. - Jesus You have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.\u2019 But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so? Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. - Jesus If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul? - Jesus Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction. So when Jesus says \u201cLove your enemies,\u201d he is setting forth a profound and ultimately inescapable admonition. Have we not come to such an impasse in the modern world that we must love our enemies\u2013 or else? The chain reaction of evil\u2013hate begetting hate, wars producing wars\u2013must be broken, or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation. - Martin Luther King, Jr. Our job is to love others without stopping to inquire whether or not they are worthy. That is not our business and, in fact, it is nobody's business. What we are asked to do is to love, and this love itself will render both ourselves and our neighbors worthy. - Thomas Merton","title":"Quotes on Love"},{"location":"wisdom/ideas/love/quotes/#quotes-on-love","text":"Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute.

There is another element that must be present in our struggle that then makes our resistance and nonviolence truly meaningful. That element is reconciliation. Our ultimate end must be the creation of the beloved community. The tactics of nonviolence without the spirit of nonviolence may indeed become a new kind of violence. - Martin Luther King, Jr.","title":"Quotes on Pacifism"},{"location":"wisdom/ideas/simplicity/gift_economy/","text":"Gift Economy Gift economy, Wikipedia","title":"Gift Economy"},{"location":"wisdom/ideas/simplicity/gift_economy/#gift-economy","text":"Gift economy, Wikipedia","title":"Gift Economy"},{"location":"wisdom/ideas/simplicity/quotes/","text":"Quotes on Simplicity As for your name and your body, which is the dearer? As for your body and your wealth, which is the more to be prized? As for gain and loss, which is the more painful? Thus, an excessive love for anything will cost you dear in the end. The storing up of too much goods will entail a heavy loss. To know when you have enough is to be immune from disgrace. To know when to stop is to be preserved from perils. Only thus can you endure long. - Lao Tzu Rejecting Mammon No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. - Jesus, Matthew 6:24 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. - Jesus, Mark 10:25 Then Jesus went into the temple of God and drove out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves. And He said to them, \u201cIt is written, \u2018My house shall be called a house of prayer,\u2019 but you have made it a \u2018den of thieves.\u2019 - Matthew 21:12-13 And He said to them, \u201cWatch out! Guard yourselves against every form of greed, for one\u2019s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.\u201d Then He told them a parable: \u201cThe ground of a certain rich man produced an abundance. So he thought to himself, \u2018What shall I do, since I have nowhere to store my crops?\u2019 Then he said, \u2018This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and will build bigger ones, and there I will store up all my grain and my goods. Then I will say to myself, \u201cYou have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take it easy. Eat, drink, and be merry!\u201d\u202f\u2019 But God said to him, \u2018You fool! This very night your life will be required of you. Then who will own what you have accumulated?\u2019 This is how it will be for anyone who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.\u201d - Jesus, The Parable of the Rich Fool, Luke 12:15-21","title":"Quotes on Simplicity"},{"location":"wisdom/ideas/simplicity/quotes/#quotes-on-simplicity","text":"As for your name and your body, which is the dearer?
